%% Identify Clusters in EEG signals using Spectral Clustering

% Input:
%   data: EEG Signals in the form (M x N), where M is the number of samples in each signal, and N is the number of signals.
%   temporal: Indicates whether or not the signals are in temporal order,
%   which can be used to improve clustering results.

% Output:
    
function [idx] = EEGClustering(data, temporal)
    
    
end
